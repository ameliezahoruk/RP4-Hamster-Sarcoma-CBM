# RP4-Hamster-Sarcoma-CBM
This repository contains a project aimed at modelling the spread of a transmissible sarcoma in hamsters, thought to be caused by the virus Mo-MSV. We use a compartment-based model to determine ways to eliminate the disease from an infected population. 
Welcome to the Mo-MSV Spread and Transmissible Tumor Modeling Repository, created as part of a school project focusing on understanding how Mo-MSV (Moloney Murine Sarcoma Virus) spreads and how a transmissible tumor grows within the Syrian golden hamster. We used a compartment-based modeling approach to simulate these processes and also explored the effects of treatments using anti-viral and chemotherapeutic drugs.

## CBM Methods:
Based on the nature of this disease, it was hypothesized that the proposed treatment would be successful and both anti-viral drugs and chemotherapeutics would be necessary to effectively treat the population and eradicate the disease. To test this, a computational model was created. This model was set to run data for a period of 1000 days for four different scenarios: a population left untreated, a population treated by MD only, a population treated by AZT only, and a population treated by both MD and AZT. If the treatment plan is ineffective, every scenario should then give the same results.

A CBM is an epidemiological model in which every individual in some large population is split into various compartments, such that each individual is in exactly one compartment at a time. The delineation of each compartment depends on the model, but typically divides individuals based on their transmissive ability. More importantly, in a CBM, each compartment is represented as a differential equation (i.e. a rate), describing the inflow and outflow of individuals. The equations are set such that outflow from one compartment means inflow into another, and vice-versa, except for birth rates. Adjusting the rates and parameters to align with those of the population creates predictive data that demonstrates how the population could theoretically behave under certain conditions. This can then be used to test various hypotheses about the population in various conditions.

The disease of interest is unique in that there are two modes of transmission: through bodily fluids, as per most retroviruses, and through transfer of the tumour cells themselves. Consequently, though our model was originally based upon the Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious model, it had to be expanded to account for the various types of “infectious”. The revised model then contains the compartments Susceptible (S), Infectious by Virus ($\displaystyle I_t$), Infectious by Virus and Tumour ($I_{vt}$), Exposed (E), Infectious by Tumour ($I_t$), and Deceased (D). We further define these compartments into two “pathways”.

The pathway that is taken is dependent on whether the trial treats for the viral load (using AZT), where treatment means that individuals are only in the S, E, $\displaystyle I_t$, and D (SE $I_t$ D model) compartments at any given time, and no treatment means individuals are only in the S, $I_v$, $I_{vt}$, and D (S $I_v I_{vt}$ D model) compartments at any given time (Figure 6). This allows the use of one model while still incorporating the different behaviours of each type of transmission. Transmission virally is considered immediately infectious, hence the lack of an exposed compartment in the pathway in which this is a method of transmission. Conversely, transmission through the passage of tumours cells requires an incubation period for the tumour to grow large enough to be contagious, hence the exposed compartment in the pathway in which this is the only method of transmission. Mathematically, this is done by relating the flow rates in and out of each compartment to the proportion treated by AZT and/or MD such that the flow rates for each variable compartment could be made zero depending on the treatment. The S $I_v I_{vt}$ D model is then considered to be the default model, when the proportion of the population treated by AZT is zero.

The susceptible compartment contains all individuals that are not infected by Mo-MSV, however are still able to contract it. All births from susceptible hamsters, per the birth rate μ, are entered into this compartment (Equation 1). The proportion of individuals treated by MD, ε, that are 𝐼# will also enter this compartment by the rate of tumour regression, κ. Susceptible hamsters will leave by the rate of transmission, β, in relation to the density of the population (we will call this relationship β). β is adjusted by the parameter ω, in relation to the proportion of the population treated by AZT, φ. This accounts for the variations in transmission rates based on the treatment method, with ω being the numerical difference between the two rates. Individuals will also leave by the natural death rate, θ.

The 𝐼" compartment contains all individuals that are infected by Mo-MSV but have not yet developed a tumour large enough be infectious in the transfer of tumour cells (Equation 2). Hamsters born of infectious mothers are infectious, but there is a growth period for the tumour to develop; thus, births of the population that are 𝐼" and 𝐼"# enter this compartment as per μ. Susceptible individuals untreated for the viral load enter this compartment by β, adjusted by ω and φ, while the ε that are 𝐼"# enter as per κ. The rate of tumour progression, α, describes the rate at which a fibrosarcoma becomes large enough to be infectious by transmission of cells; individuals then will leave this compartment by α. 𝐼" hamsters will also leave by θ.

The 𝐼"# compartment contains all subjects that are infected by Mo-MSV who have also developed a tumour large enough to be infectious (Equation 3). This compartment accepts the 𝐼" individuals as per α. The ε in this compartment will leave as per κ. Individuals now leave per the disease-induced death rate, δ, along with θ.

The exposed compartment is a pathway induced by AZT, containing all infected hamsters, and are thus developing tumours, but are not yet infectious (Equation 4). These individuals have been treated for the viral load; however, their tumours are not yet large enough to spread. φ will enter this compartment by β, adjusted by ω and φ. Births by exposed and 𝐼" individuals will also enter this compartment. Exposed subjects will leave by α, which here describes the rate at which individuals become infectious.

The 𝐼# compartment contains all hamsters that have developed infectious tumours but have been treated for the viral-load of Mo-MSV and thus can only spread the cancer through passage of tumour cells (Equation 5). Exposed individuals enter here by α. 𝐼# individuals leave by δ and θ, while the ε of them can leave by κ.

The deceased compartment represents, quite simply, all the deceased hamsters (Equation 6). Subjects in all other compartments enter this compartment by θ, while individuals that are 𝐼# and 𝐼"# may also enter by δ.

The model assumes an initial population, N, of 1000; a carrying capacity, K, of 1000; and an initial population of infectious individuals of 100. Note that infectious individuals start in 𝐼# if AZT is used or 𝐼"# if it is not. It presumes the population is stable, in that the birth rate is equal to the natural death rate, at 0.00137 hamsters/day.42 It also assumes daily, oral administration of the treatment.

We consider an individual to be infectious by tumour once the tumour reaches a diameter of 1 cm; thus, the rate of tumour progression is about 0.158 cm3/day. Conversely, the rate of tumour regression, under the treatment of MD, is 0.132 cm3/day, where metformin is given at 346.80 mg/kg/day and diclofenac is given at 21.75 mg/kg/day. The rates were derived from a study by Popovic et. al, 2023, using mean tumour volume after 19 days to find an average daily rate for both the untreated and treated by MD. Hamster sarcomas have been shownto kill the individual in 30 days; after incorporating the “incubation” period, where the tumour is below 1 cm, the disease-induced death rate is taken to be 0.042 hamsters/day. The transmission rate is also dependent on treatment. When untreated for the viral load, the transmission rate is 0.2/day, while when treated by AZT at 63 mg/kg/day, the transmission rate is 0.05/day. This is due to the change in probability of an interaction between two hamsters facilitating the spread of the disease. When spread through viral load is possible, any transmission of bodily fluids will facilitate the spread of Mo-MSV. Conversely, transmission via tumour cells requires contact with the tumour itself; this is less likely to occur in a set interaction, given that tumour cells are concentration in one region of the body, while bodily fluids, such as blood, are distributed throughout.

Like any other theoretical model, there are certain assumptions that must be addressed before comparing it to a real-world system. Firstly, due to the nature of a compartment-based model, all behaviours are assumed to be uniform. For example, this model dictates that every hamster dies naturally after two years – in a real-world system, this number can vary up to four years, thus the model is not accurately representing these cases. Similar statements can be made for the other given rates/parameters. Additionally, though this model attempts to represent a wild population of Syrian hamsters, transmissible hamster sarcomas have only been demonstrated in laboratory settings. Consequently, most of the rates are lab-based, and thus may be less accurate for this model type. Further, due to the lack of research done in this field, especially recent research, the transmission rate was estimated based on the behaviours of hamsters and how often they interact in such a way that the disease would be spread, rather than an actual known transmission rate for Mo-MSV. To facilitate a simpler model, we also assumed AZT that immediately reduces the viral load to zero; realistically, it could take up to a month for the viral load to be completely reduced, thus decreasing the accuracy of the model. Further, AZT has not been shown to be necessarily 100% effective in completely eradicating the viral load; rather, it has been shown to completely reduce the viral load in 75% of a given population and reduce it to very low levels in the other 25%. This assumption thus decreases the effectivity of our treatment, which could influence the results of the model. Similarly, we assume that the tumour can be completely eradicated (returning individuals to the susceptible compartment), which has not yet been proven to be possible with our proposed treatment – rather, the tumour will get so small that it is no longer contagious.1 This makes it more difficult to determine at what point we no longer musttreat the population, since the susceptible compartment, in the real-world system, would contain hamsters that technically still have a tumour. Additionally, we presume that all births, unless by susceptible individuals, are infected, which is not always true; rather, it is a high possibility if the mother has Mo-MSV or its products.

Despite these assumptions, the model still considers and accounts for various aspects of the disease as well as for the behaviours of the population. Thus, the model can be used as a relatively accurate guideline for the behaviour of this population in each of these scenarios.
